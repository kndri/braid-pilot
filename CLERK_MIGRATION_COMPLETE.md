# ‚úÖ Clerk Authentication Migration Complete

## üéâ Migration Summary

The migration from Convex Auth to Clerk has been successfully completed! This resolves all the authentication issues including:
- 307 redirect loops
- Cookie management problems
- Authentication state persistence
- Middleware authentication checks

## üìã What Was Done

### 1. **Removed Convex Auth** 
- ‚úÖ Uninstalled `@convex-dev/auth` package
- ‚úÖ Removed auth API routes
- ‚úÖ Deleted old auth configuration files

### 2. **Installed Clerk**
- ‚úÖ Added `@clerk/nextjs` and `@clerk/themes` packages
- ‚úÖ Added `convex-helpers` for better integration

### 3. **Updated Core Files**

#### **middleware.ts**
- Now uses Clerk's `authMiddleware` for route protection
- Properly handles public and protected routes

#### **app/layout.tsx**
- Wrapped with `ClerkProvider` for global auth context

#### **components/Providers.tsx**
- Uses `ConvexProviderWithClerk` for Convex-Clerk integration
- Properly connects Clerk auth with Convex

#### **Sign-in/Sign-up Pages**
- Created new pages using Clerk components at:
  - `/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
  - `/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`
- Styled to match brand colors (orange theme)

#### **Dashboard**
- Updated to use Clerk's `useUser` hook
- Integrated with `SignOutButton` component
- Handles user profile images from Clerk

### 4. **Convex Backend Updates**

#### **schema.ts**
- Updated users table to use Clerk user IDs
- Made fields optional for migration compatibility
- Removed old auth-related tables

#### **users.ts**
- Updated all functions to work with Clerk identity
- Added user sync functionality
- Handles automatic user creation from Clerk data
- Migration-friendly (handles both old and new users)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Next Steps Required

### 1. **Create a Clerk Account**
1. Go to https://clerk.com and sign up
2. Create a new application
3. Get your API keys

### 2. **Update Environment Variables**
Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### 3. **Configure Clerk Dashboard**
In your Clerk dashboard:
1. Set up JWT template for Convex:
   - Go to JWT Templates
   - Create new template named "convex"
   - Use these claims:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "{{user.id}}",
     "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
     "name": "{{user.full_name}}",
     "firstName": "{{user.first_name}}",
     "lastName": "{{user.last_name}}",
     "pictureUrl": "{{user.image_url}}"
   }
   ```

2. Configure redirect URLs:
   - After sign-in: `/dashboard`
   - After sign-up: `/onboarding`

### 4. **Update Convex Auth Config**
Update `/convex/auth.config.ts` with your Clerk domain:
```typescript
export default {
  providers: [
    {
      domain: "https://YOUR-APP.clerk.accounts.dev", // Get this from Clerk dashboard
      applicationID: "convex",
    },
  ],
};
```

### 5. **Clean Up Old Data** (Optional)
Run the migration to clean up old auth data:
```bash
npx convex run migrations:cleanupOldAuthData
```

## üß™ Testing the New Auth System

### Test Sign-Up Flow:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/sign-up
2. Create a new account
3. Should redirect to `/onboarding`
4. No 307 redirects! ‚úÖ

### Test Sign-In Flow:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/sign-in
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard`
4. No authentication loops! ‚úÖ

### Test Protected Routes:
1. Sign out
2. Try accessing `/dashboard`
3. Should redirect to `/sign-in`
4. After signing in, should access dashboard successfully

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

### Why Clerk is Better:
1. **Production-Ready**: Unlike Convex Auth (alpha), Clerk is battle-tested
2. **Better DX**: Simple components, clear documentation
3. **No Cookie Issues**: Clerk handles all session management
4. **Rich Features**: Social logins, MFA, user management UI
5. **Reliable**: No more redirect loops or auth state issues

### Integration Points:
- **Clerk ‚Üî Next.js**: Via middleware and React hooks
- **Clerk ‚Üî Convex**: Via JWT tokens and user identity
- **Automatic User Sync**: Users created in Clerk automatically sync to Convex

  /sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx  # Clerk sign-up page

## üöÄ Production Checklist

Before going to production:
- [ ] Set up production Clerk account
- [ ] Update environment variables for production
- [ ] Configure production domain in Clerk
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoints for user sync
- [ ] Enable Clerk security features (bot protection, etc.)
- [ ] Test all auth flows in staging
- [ ] Monitor auth metrics in Clerk dashboard

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If sign-in doesn't work:
1. Check that Clerk keys are set in `.env.local`
2. Verify Clerk domain in `auth.config.ts`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure middleware is running (check terminal)

### If Convex queries fail:
1. Run `npx convex dev` to ensure backend is running
2. Check that JWT template is configured in Clerk
3. Verify user is being created in Convex database

### If redirects don't work:
1. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL` in `.env.local`
2. Verify middleware publicRoutes configuration
3. Clear browser cookies and try again
