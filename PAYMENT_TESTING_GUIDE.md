# Payment Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Return URL Issue - FIXED

### Problem
Stripe reported that payments were failing because the `return_url` parameter was missing. This parameter is required for payment methods that need authentication redirects (like 3D Secure cards).

### Solution Implemented
1. **Added `/booking-success` page** - Created a dedicated page to handle payment redirects
2. **Updated `StripePaymentForm.tsx`** - The return_url was already present but pointing to a non-existent page
3. **Return URL configuration** - Set to `${window.location.origin}/booking-success?booking_id=${bookingId}`

### Files Modified/Created
- `/app/booking-success/page.tsx` - New page to handle payment redirects
- `/components/booking/StripePaymentForm.tsx` - Already had return_url configured correctly

## üß™ Test Scripts Available

### 1. Complete Test Payment
```bash
node scripts/complete-test-payment.js
```
- Creates and confirms test payments
- Generates multiple transactions for testing
- Shows up as completed payments in Stripe Dashboard

### 2. Quick Payment Intent Test
```bash
node scripts/test-stripe-payment.js
```
- Creates a payment intent via the API
- Tests the `/api/stripe/create-payment-intent` endpoint
- Useful for quick API verification

### 3. Payment with Redirect Test
```bash
node scripts/test-payment-with-redirect.js
```
- Tests standard card payments
- Simulates 3D Secure scenarios
- Verifies return_url configuration
- Tests webhook metadata

### 4. 3D Secure Flow Test
```bash
node scripts/test-3d-secure-payment.js
```
- Specifically tests 3D Secure authentication flows
- Shows how redirect parameters work
- Verifies the booking-success page handling

## üí≥ Stripe Test Cards

### Standard Cards (No Authentication)
- `4242 4242 4242 4242` - Visa (succeeds)
- `4000 0000 0000 0002` - Declined
- `4000 0000 0000 9995` - Insufficient funds

### 3D Secure Cards (Requires Authentication)
- `4000 0025 0000 3155` - Always requires authentication
- `4000 0027 6000 3184` - Authentication must succeed
- `4000 0082 6000 3178` - Authentication must fail

## üîç Verifying the Fix

### In Development
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the quote tool
3. Complete a booking with payment
4. Verify payment succeeds and redirects properly

### In Stripe Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
2. You should see test payments with:
   - Status: "Succeeded" for completed payments
   - Metadata showing booking details
   - $5.00 amount for each booking fee

### Test the Redirect Flow
1. The `/booking-success` page handles these parameters:
   - `payment_intent` - Stripe payment intent ID
   - `payment_intent_client_secret` - Client secret for verification
   - `redirect_status` - Status after redirect (succeeded/failed/requires_payment_method)
   - `booking_id` - Our internal booking ID

## üìä Current Payment Status

### What's Working
‚úÖ Standard card payments (immediate confirmation)
‚úÖ Return URL properly configured
‚úÖ Booking success page created and functional
‚úÖ Payment metadata includes all booking details
‚úÖ Webhook endpoint ready for events
‚úÖ $5 platform fee correctly charged
‚úÖ Service price shown but collected at salon

### Payment Flow
1. Client selects service and fills booking form
2. Payment form shows:
   - $5 booking fee (charged now)
   - Service price (pay at salon)
3. Stripe processes the $5 booking fee
4. On success, redirects to `/booking-success`
5. Booking is confirmed in the database
6. Client receives confirmation email

## üöÄ Production Readiness

The payment system is now ready for production with:
- ‚úÖ Proper return_url handling for all payment methods
- ‚úÖ Support for 3D Secure authentication
- ‚úÖ Clear pricing breakdown (platform fee vs service price)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Success page for payment confirmations
- ‚úÖ Test coverage for various scenarios
