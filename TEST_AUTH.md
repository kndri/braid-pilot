# Authentication Testing Guide

## Fixes Applied

1. **Added `isAuthenticated` export** to `/convex/auth.ts`
   - This is required by Convex Auth 0.0.76+
   - Enables the middleware to check authentication status

2. **Fixed ConvexProviderWithAuth** in `/components/Providers.tsx`
   - Properly configured the auth provider
   - Connected to the `/api/auth` endpoint

3. **Updated sign-in flow** in `/app/sign-in/page.tsx`
   - Uses router.refresh() to update auth state
   - Properly redirects after successful login

## Test Steps

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Sign Up**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/sign-up
   - Create a new account
   - Should redirect to /onboarding after success

3. **Test Sign In**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/sign-in
   - Use your credentials
   - Should redirect to /dashboard after success
   - No more 307 redirect loops\!

4. **Test Protected Routes**:
   - Try accessing /dashboard when logged out â†’ redirects to /sign-in
   - After login, /dashboard should be accessible

## Debugging

Check the console for:
- `Middleware: Path=/dashboard, Authenticated=true` (should be true after login)

## Important Notes

- The JWT_PRIVATE_KEY and JWKS must be set in Convex dashboard
- Authentication cookies are managed by Convex Auth automatically
- Full page refresh may be needed after sign-in to update auth state
