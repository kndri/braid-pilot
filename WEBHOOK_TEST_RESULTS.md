   - Release time slots on cancellation

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Send confirmation on payment success
   - Notify customer of payment failures
   - Send refund confirmations

3. **Production Setup**
   - Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
   - Use production webhook secret
   - Configure production URL

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Create Production Webhook:**
   - Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
   - Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select events: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed, payment_intent.canceled, charge.refunded
   - Copy webhook secret to production environment

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Production .env
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[production_secret_from_dashboard]
   ```

3. **Test in Production:**
   - Use Stripe's webhook testing tools
   - Monitor webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard
   - Verify all events are processed correctly

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Install and configure Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
stripe login

# Start webhook forwarding
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
stripe trigger payment_intent.canceled
stripe trigger charge.refunded
```

## Conclusion

The booking fee webhook implementation is working correctly in the local environment. All critical payment events are being received and processed. The system is ready for production deployment once the webhook is configured in the Stripe Dashboard.
