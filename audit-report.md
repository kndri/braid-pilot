# Next.js Performance & Security Audit Report

## 1. Executive Summary

**Verdict: NOT PRODUCTION-READY - CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

This Next.js application has **severe security vulnerabilities** that must be addressed immediately before any production deployment. The most critical finding is the exposure of production API keys and secrets in version control, including Clerk authentication keys, Convex deployment keys, and multiple third-party service credentials. This represents an immediate and severe security risk.

Beyond security, the application suffers from significant performance issues including excessive client-side rendering, missing optimizations, and no implementation of static generation despite having numerous opportunities for it. The codebase shows a pattern of development without security-first thinking or performance optimization strategies.

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** 
- 11 high-severity security vulnerabilities
- 8 major performance issues
- Immediate action required on exposed secrets

## 2. Findings & Mitigation Plan

### **Finding 1: Production Secrets Exposed in Version Control**
* **Type:** Security - Critical Data Leak
* **Description:** Multiple files contain hard-coded production secrets committed to the repository:
  - `.env.production` (Lines 4-31): Contains Clerk production keys, Convex deploy key, Vapi API key, ElevenLabs API key, Gemini API key, and JWT private keys
  - `.env.local` (Lines 29-36): Additional API keys exposed
  - `jwt_key.pem`: Entire private key file in repository
  - `CONVEX_ENV_KEYS.txt`: Script containing private keys
  - `set-keys.sh`: Shell script with embedded secrets
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of all integrated services. Attackers can impersonate the application, access user data, make unauthorized API calls costing money, and potentially pivot to attack users.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Immediately rotate ALL exposed API keys and secrets
    * Remove all secret files from git history using `git filter-branch`
    * Add `.env*`, `*.pem`, and sensitive files to `.gitignore`
    * Implement secret management via Vercel environment variables
    * Enable GitHub secret scanning alerts

---

### **Finding 2: No Input Validation or Sanitization**
* **Type:** Security - XSS/Injection Risk
* **Description:** Multiple components accept and render user input without validation:
  - `app/salon-setup/page.tsx` (Lines 49-52): Form data sent directly without server validation
  - `components/quote/QuoteToolRedesigned.tsx`: No input sanitization on user selections
  - `convex/vapiWebhook.ts` (Line 279): User input concatenated into responses without escaping
  - `components/booking/BookingFormRedesigned.tsx`: Email/phone validation only on client-side
* **Impact:** XSS attacks, SQL injection potential, malformed data in database, potential for stored XSS affecting multiple users.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Implement Zod schemas for all input validation
    * Add server-side validation in all Convex mutations
    * Use DOMPurify for rendering any user-generated content
    * Implement Content Security Policy headers
    * Add input type restrictions and length limits

---

### **Finding 3: Excessive Client-Side Rendering**
* **Type:** Performance - Core Web Vitals
* **Description:** 85+ components unnecessarily use the `'use client'` directive, forcing client-side rendering for content that could be statically generated or server-rendered. No pages use `getStaticProps` or implement ISR.
* **Impact:** Poor FCP (First Contentful Paint), high TTI (Time to Interactive), increased bandwidth usage, poor SEO, and degraded mobile experience.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Convert static components to React Server Components
    * Implement SSG for marketing pages (`/`, `/features`, `/pricing`)
    * Use ISR with 60-second revalidation for dashboard pages
    * Move data fetching to server components where possible
    * Implement proper loading.tsx and error.tsx boundaries

---

### **Finding 4: Missing Authentication & Authorization Checks**
* **Type:** Security - Access Control
* **Description:** Multiple Convex queries and mutations lack proper authorization:
  - `convex/quote.ts` (Lines 5-50): Public endpoints with no rate limiting
  - `convex/crm.ts`: No verification that user owns the salon they're querying
  - `convex/booking.ts`: Missing validation of salon ownership
  - No RBAC implementation for different user types
* **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, potential data manipulation, ability to view other salons' data, booking manipulation.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Add authorization checks to ALL Convex functions
    * Implement salon ownership validation middleware
    * Add rate limiting using Upstash Redis
    * Implement RBAC with user roles (owner, staff, client)
    * Add API key rotation mechanism

---

### **Finding 5: No Security Headers Configured**
* **Type:** Security - Missing Protections
* **Description:** The application lacks essential security headers. `next.config.ts` has no security header configuration, leaving the app vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, and other attacks.
* **Impact:** Vulnerable to iframe embedding, XSS attacks, MIME type confusion, and missing HTTPS enforcement.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Add security headers to `next.config.ts`:
      - X-Frame-Options: DENY
      - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
      - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
      - Strict-Transport-Security
      - Content-Security-Policy
    * Implement CORS properly for API routes
    * Add referrer-policy and permissions-policy

---

### **Finding 6: Unoptimized Bundle Size**
* **Type:** Performance - Bundle Optimization
* **Description:** Large dependencies loaded on every page:
  - Framer Motion (95KB gzipped) loaded globally
  - Multiple icon libraries (Lucide + Heroicons)
  - No code splitting for large components
  - No dynamic imports implemented
  - React Query and Convex loaded on all pages
* **Impact:** Slow initial page load, high bandwidth usage, poor mobile performance, increased hosting costs.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Dynamically import Framer Motion only where needed
    * Consolidate to single icon library (Lucide)
    * Implement route-based code splitting
    * Lazy load heavy components (charts, calendars)
    * Use next/dynamic for below-the-fold content
    * Enable SWC minification in next.config.ts

---

### **Finding 7: Images Not Optimized**
* **Type:** Performance - Asset Optimization
* **Description:** Only 2 files in the entire codebase use `next/image`. Most images are unoptimized, no responsive images configured, missing lazy loading, and no WebP/AVIF formats.
* **Impact:** High bandwidth usage, slow LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), poor CLS scores, degraded mobile experience.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Replace all `<img>` tags with `next/image`
    * Configure responsive image sizes
    * Implement blur placeholders for above-fold images
    * Set up image optimization API routes
    * Use WebP format with fallbacks
    * Add preload hints for hero images

---

### **Finding 8: Database Credentials in Schema**
* **Type:** Security - Data Leak
* **Description:** `convex/schema.ts` (Lines 32-40) stores sensitive Twilio credentials and API keys directly in the database without encryption. Voice settings and configuration also exposed.
* **Impact:** Database breach would expose all third-party service credentials, allowing attackers to use services at company expense.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Move credentials to environment variables
    * Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
    * Use AWS KMS or similar for key management
    * Implement credential rotation mechanism
    * Add audit logging for credential access

---

### **Finding 9: No Error Boundaries**
* **Type:** Security & Performance - Error Handling
* **Description:** No error boundaries implemented, unhandled promise rejections, stack traces potentially exposed to users, no centralized error logging.
* **Impact:** Application crashes affect entire page, sensitive error information exposed, poor user experience, missing error tracking.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Implement error.tsx in all route segments
    * Add global error boundary in root layout
    * Integrate Sentry for error tracking
    * Sanitize error messages for production
    * Implement proper error logging
    * Add fallback UI for error states

---

### **Finding 10: Missing Font Optimization**
* **Type:** Performance - Asset Loading
* **Description:** `app/layout.tsx` (Lines 8-11) loads fonts without optimization. No font-display swap, no preloading, potential FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).
* **Impact:** Poor CLS scores, delayed text rendering, suboptimal perceived performance.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Use next/font for automatic optimization
    * Add font-display: swap
    * Preload critical fonts
    * Subset fonts to reduce size
    * Implement fallback font stack
    * Use variable fonts where possible

---

### **Finding 11: No CSRF Protection**
* **Type:** Security - Request Forgery
* **Description:** Form submissions and state-changing operations lack CSRF tokens. No double-submit cookie pattern implemented. API routes accept requests without origin validation.
* **Impact:** Vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks, potential for unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Implement CSRF tokens for all forms
    * Add SameSite cookie attributes
    * Validate request origin in API routes
    * Use double-submit cookie pattern
    * Add request signing for sensitive operations

---

### **Finding 12: Webhook Security Issues**
* **Type:** Security - Webhook Validation
* **Description:** `convex/vapiWebhook.ts` accepts webhooks without signature verification. No replay attack protection. No timestamp validation.
* **Impact:** Attackers can send fake webhook events, potentially manipulating application state or triggering unwanted actions.
* **Mitigation Plan:**
    * Implement webhook signature verification
    * Add timestamp validation (5-minute window)
    * Store and check for replay attacks
    * Rate limit webhook endpoints
    * Add webhook event logging
    * Implement webhook retry mechanism

---

### **Finding 13: No Rate Limiting**
* **Type:** Security - DoS Protection
