# Development & Testing Scripts

This directory contains scripts for seeding and managing test data in your Braid Pilot application.

## üå± Seeding Development Data

### Quick Start

```bash
# Seed the database with comprehensive test data
npm run seed

# Clean up all test data
npm run seed:clean
```

### What Gets Seeded

When you run `npm run seed`, the following data is created:

- **1 Salon**: "Elite Braids & Beauty" with full configuration
- **6 Braiders**: Each with different commission splits (50-70%) and specialties
- **100 Clients**: With various tags (VIP, Regular, New) and preferences
- **150 Bookings**: Mix of past, present, and future bookings with different statuses
- **8 Hair Styles**: With complete pricing configurations
- **Notifications**: Sample notifications for the salon owner

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your-convex-url
SEED_USER_EMAIL=test@elitebraids.com  # Optional, defaults to test@elitebraids.com
SEED_CLERK_ID=clerk_user_id            # Optional, for linking to specific Clerk user
```

## üîß Manual Testing Workflow

1. **Start fresh**:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:clean  # Clean any existing data
   npm run seed        # Seed fresh data
   ```

2. **Login to dashboard**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   - Use the seeded email: test@elitebraids.com

3. **Explore features**:
   - View 6 braiders with different splits
   - Check 150 bookings across different dates
   - Review 100 client profiles
   - Test capacity management
   - Try the quote tool

4. **Clean up when done**:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:clean
   ```

## üö® Important Notes

- **Development Only**: These scripts are for development/testing only
- **Data Persistence**: Seeded data persists until manually cleaned
- **Idempotent**: Running seed multiple times may create duplicate data
- **Clean First**: Always run `seed:clean` before `seed` for fresh data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL"
Make sure your `.env.local` file contains the Convex URL:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
```

### "User or salon not found" during cleanup
The user might not exist. This is safe to ignore.

### Seed fails with "User already has salon"
Run `npm run seed:clean` first to remove existing data.

## üìù Custom Seeding

To seed with specific parameters, modify the `seed-dev.ts` script:

```typescript
const result = await client.mutation(api.seed.seedDevelopmentData, {
  userEmail: "custom@email.com",
  // Add more parameters as needed
});
```
